Early works handcrafted this representation based\\non domain knowledge. However, social interactions in crowded\\nenvironments are not only diverse but often subtle. Recently,\\ndeep learning methods have outperformed their handcrafted\\ncounterparts, as they learned about human-human interactions\\nin a more generic data-driven fashion. In this work, we present\\nan in-depth analysis of existing deep learning-based methods\\nfor modelling social interactions. We propose two knowledge-\\nbased data-driven methods to effectively capture these social\\ninteractions. To objectively compare the performance of these')"
