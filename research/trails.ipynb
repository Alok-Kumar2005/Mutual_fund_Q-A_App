Early works handcrafted this representation based\\non domain knowledge. However, social interactions in crowded\\nenvironments are not only diverse but often subtle. Recently,\\ndeep learning methods have outperformed their handcrafted\\ncounterparts, as they learned about human-human interactions\\nin a more generic data-driven fashion. In this work, we present\\nan in-depth analysis of existing deep learning-based methods\\nfor modelling social interactions. We propose two knowledge-\\nbased data-driven methods to effectively capture these social\\ninteractions. To objectively compare the performance of these')"

The model is unique in that it focuses on scenes where interactions occur, such as pedestrian collisions or social gatherings, and uses novel metrics to evaluate the physical feasibility of its predictions.\\n\\nThe model's design is based on an in-depth analysis of existing interaction module designs in the literature, and it proposes two domain-knowledge based interaction models. The TrajNet++ model is evaluated using a comprehensive evaluation system that includes collision-based metrics, which helps to assess the physical feasibility of its predictions.\\n\\nOverall, TrajNet++ is a novel and innovative model that addresses the lack of a definitive comparison between existing interaction models and provides a more comprehensive evaluation system for human trajectory forecasting.
